# EUTxO crash course

If you have absolutely no idea what developing on Cardano looks like, worry
not. You just found the right piece to get started. Aiken is a language platform
that makes on-chain programming easy. But what is _"on-chain programming"_ to
begin with? While this succinct documentation piece has no ambition to be a
complete course on blockchains, it should give you enough insights to build a
basic understanding of the fundamentals.

<Callout type="warning">
  This course will reference cryptography concepts such as **hash digests** or
  **digital signatures**. We, therefore, expect readers to be either familiar
  with those concepts (at least a tiny bit) or to read up on them. There are
  plenty of resources available in the wild regarding cryptography and this
  crash course **isn't** one of them.

  As a suggestion, if you want to learn more on those fundamentals, we
  heartwarmingly recommend [Cardano Blockchain Certified Associate (CBCA)'s first
  module](https://academy.cardanofoundation.org/).

## Blocks & transactions

Blockchains are made of blocks. And blocks are made of transactions. Without
going into the details, you can think of blocks as being objects divided into
two parts: a header and a body. The header contains information about the
blocks, such as who produced them and when they were made. The body is nothing
more than an ordered sequence of transactions.

Note that the _"chain"_ of blockchain comes from how blocks reference one
another. Indeed, each block header includes at least two things:

- A hash digest of the block body
- A hash digest of the previous block header

```console filename="Block"
┏━ Header ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━ Body ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃                       ┃                                           ┃
┃  Body hash            ┃ ┌────────────────┬────────────────┬─────┐ ┃
┃  Previous header hash ┃ │ Transaction #1 │ Transaction #2 │ ... │ ┃
┃  Timestamp            ┃ └────────────────┴────────────────┴─────┘ ┃
┃                       ┃                                           ┃
┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┻━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛
```

A hash digest is a tamper-proof mechanism that maps an input value to a
fixed-sized output. Think of it as a way to assign an identifier to a piece of
content, such that the identifier depends on the content itself: change the
content, change the identifier.

A chain is formed by including in every block header:

- a hash of the block body; and
- a header hash of the previous block.

Changing any transaction in a block will change the block body hash, thus
changing the block header hash, the header hash of the next block, and so on,
invalidating the entire chain that follows.

```
        ____          ____          ____          ____          ____
       /    /\       /    /\       /    /\       /    /\       /    /\
o ❮❮  /____/  \ ❮❮  /____/  \ ❮❮  /____/  \ ❮❮  /____/  \ ❮❮  /____/  \ ...
      \    \  /     \    \  /     \    \  /     \    \  /     \    \  /
╿      \____\/       \____\/       \____\/       \____\/       \____\/
│
│                                     ╿
│                                     │
└ Genesis configuration               │
                                      └ Block
```

A transaction is, therefore, the most fundamental primitive on blockchains.
They are the mechanism whereby users (a.k.a you) can take actions to change the
state of the blockchain. A chain starts from an initial state typically
referred to as _genesis configuration_. And from there, transactions map a
previous state into a new state. Finally, blocks are merely there to batch
transactions together.

## Unspent Transaction Outputs

In the traditional database world, a _transaction_ is a means to bundle
together a series of atomic operations so that all are successful or none
happen. In the financial world, it is a way to transfer assets from one
location to another.

In the blockchain world, it is a bit of both.

A transaction is, first and foremost, an object with an input from where it
takes assets and an output to where it sends them. Often, as is the case in
Cardano, transactions have many inputs and many outputs. And, in addition to
inputs and outputs, blockchain protocols often include other elements that
modify different parts of the blockchain state (e.g. delegation certificates,
governance votes, user-defined assets definitions...)

More so, like in the database world, a transaction is an all-or-nothing atomic
series of commands. Either it is valid, and all its changes are applied, or it
isn't, and none are applied.

We'll talk more about other capabilities later. For now, let's focus on inputs
and outputs, starting with the outputs.

### Outputs

In Cardano, an output is an object that describes at least two things:

- a quantity of assets -- also known as, a _value_;
- a condition for spending (and/or delegating) those assets -- also known as an _address_.

In addition, a data payload can also be added to outputs but let's not bother
with that just now. The role of the value is pretty transparent, and it
indicates how many assets hold the output.

Incidentally, Cardano supports two kinds of assets: the main protocol currency
(a.k.a. Ada); and user-defined currencies. Both live side-by-side in values
though slightly different rules apply to each.

The address captures the logic that tells the protocol under what conditions
one can utilize the assets at a particular output. It is what defines ownership
of the assets. We'll explore this very soon. Bear with us a little more.

```console filename="Output"
┏━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃         ┃           ┃                ┃
┃  Value  ┃  Address  ┃  Data payload  ┃
┃         ┃           ┃                ┃
┗━━━━━━━━━┻━━━━━━━━━━━┻━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛
```

### Inputs

An input is a reference to a previous output. Think of outputs as post-it notes
with a unique serial number and inputs as being this serial number.

![](/post-it-notes.jpg)

A transaction is a document indicating which post-it notes should be destroyed
and which new ones should be pinned to the wall. Note that there are rules
regarding the construction of transactions. For example, there must be as much
value in as there's value out. Said differently, the total value should balance
out but might be shuffled differently.

An output that hasn't been spent yet (i.e. is still on the wall) is called --
you guessed it -- an _unspent transaction output_, or UTxO in short. The
blockchain state results from looking at the entire wall of remaining post-it
notes. In addition to all of the available UTxOs, the state also includes any additional data
defined by the protocol.

Okay, back to inputs.

Technically speaking, an input's _"serial number"_ is the hash digest of the
transaction that emitted the output it refers to and the position of the output
within that transaction. These two elements make each input unique. And because
outputs are removed from the available set (the post-it note is destroyed) when
spent, they can only be spent once. This is ensured by the blockchain
protocol.

```console filename="Input"
┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃                    ┃                ┃
┃  Transaction hash  ┃  Output index  ┃
┃                    ┃                ┃
┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┻━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛
```

<Callout type="info">
Where do the first outputs come from?

If you've carefully followed the narrative we just went through, you might have
realized that we have a chicken-and-egg situation. Inputs are references to
outputs. And outputs are created by spending inputs.

This is what the genesis configuration is for. It defines the starting point of
the blockchain in the form of an agreed-upon initial list of outputs. Those
outputs can be referred to using some special identifiers. For example, the
genesis configuration hash digest and the output's position in the
configuration.

How the genesis configuration comes to be is also an interesting question but
out of the scope of the current course. In the case of Cardano, the initial
distribution resulted from an initial token vouchers sale where a portion of the
total Ada supply was sold in the form of vouchers to stakeholders before the
launch of the network.

</Callout>

### TL;DR

Let's quickly recap what we've seen so far:

- A blockchain has an initial state called a _genesis configuration_;
- A _transaction_ captures instructions to modify that state (e.g. transfer of assets);
- A _block_ batches transactions together and has a reference to a parent block;
- Assets movement are expressed using _inputs_ and _outputs_ in transactions;
- An _output_ is an object with at least an _address_ and a _value_;
- An _address_ describes the conditions needed to use the _value_ associated with it;
- An _input_ is a reference to a previous _output_.

## Addresses

### Overview

It is now time to delve more into Cardano addresses. A typical address is made
of 2 or 3 parts:

```console filename="Address"
┏━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃          ┃                       ┃                          ┃
┃  Header  ┃  Payment credentials  ┃  Delegation credentials  ┃
┃          ┃                       ┃                          ┃
┗━━━━━━━━━━┻━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┻━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛
```

We said 2 or 3 because the last part -- the delegation credentials -- is
optional. The first part is called the `Header`, and it describes the type of
address (i.e. what comes next) and the network within which this address can be
used. We call that last bit a _network discriminant_ and it prevents silly
mistakes like sending real Mainnet funds to a test address. An address is
represented as a sequence of bytes, usually encoded using
[bech32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0173.mediawiki#user-content-Introduction)
or simply [base16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal) text strings.

For example:

```console filename="An address (bech32)"
addr1x8phkx6acpnf78fuvxn0mkew3l0fd058hzquvz7w36x4gt7r0vd4msrxnuwnccdxlhdjar77j6lg0wypcc9uar5d2shskhj42g
```

or alternatively

```console filename="The same address (base16)"
31c37b1b5dc0669f1d3c61a6fddb2e8fde96be87b881c60bce8e8d542fc37b1b5dc0669f1d3c61a6fddb2e8fde96be87b881c60bce8e8d542f
```

We can dissect the latter text string to make the three parts mentioned above more apparent:

```
               Type = 3 ┐┌ Network = 1 (1 = mainnet, 0 = testnet)
                        ││
                        ╽╽
Header:                 31
Payment credentials:    c37b1b5dc0669f1d3c61a6fddb2e8fde96be87b881c60bce8e8d542f
Delegation credentials: c37b1b5dc0669f1d3c61a6fddb2e8fde96be87b881c60bce8e8d542f
```

As we can see, this address is a type 3, is for mainnet and uses the same
credentials for both the payment and the delegation part.

<Callout type="info">
  You will often need to convert back-and-forth between bech32-encoded strings
  and hex-encoded strings. A great command-line tool for working with bech32 can
  be found at
  [input-output-hk/bech32](https://github.com/input-output-hk/bech32#bech32-command-line).
  Use it!
</Callout>

### Payment credentials

The next part is the _payment credentials_, also called the _payment part_.
This is what describes the spending conditions for the address. Remember how
UTxOs are like post-it notes on a wall? Well, you don't get to hang them or pick
them up directly yourself. You have to hand over a _transaction_ to the network
validators. Imagine an employee who's gatekeeping the wall of post-it notes and
to whom you must give a form that describes what you want to do. Written on each post-it
note are the conditions that must be met before it can be picked up and destroyed. That's what the payment credentials are for in the address. They come in
one of two forms:

- a verification key hash digest; or
- a script hash digest.

In the first form, the validator nodes -- or the employee -- will ask you to
provide a digital signature from the signing key corresponding to the
verification key. This approach relies on asymmetric cryptography, where one
generates credentials as a public (verification) and private (signing) key
pair. In the address, we store only a hash digest of the verification key for
conciseness and to avoid revealing it too early (even though it is public
material). When spending from such an address, one must reveal the public key
and show a signature of the entire transaction as _witnesses_ (a.k.a proofs).
This way of specifying spending conditions is relatively straightforward but
also constrained because it doesn't allow for expressing any elaborate logic.

This is where the second form gets more interesting. Cardano allows locking
funds using a script representing the validation logic that must be satisfied
to spend funds guarded by the address. We typically call such addresses
"_script addresses_". Similarly to the first form, the entire script must be
provided as a witness by any transaction spending from a script address, as
well as any other elements required by the script. Scripts are like predicates.
Said differently, they are functions that return a boolean value: `True` or
`False`. To be considered valid, all scripts in a transaction must return
`True`. We'll explore how this mechanism works in a short moment.

### Delegation credentials

Addresses may also contain _delegation credentials_, also called a _delegation
part_. We will only go a little into the details here, but think of the delegation
credentials as a way to control what can be done with the _stake_ associated with
the address. The _stake_ corresponds to the Ada quantity in the output's value
that the consensus protocol counts to elect block producers. In Cardano,
the stake can be delegated to registered entities called stake pools. By
delegating, one indicates that the stake associated with an output should be
counted as if it belonged to the delegatee, increasing their chance of
producing a block. In return, the delegatee agrees to share a portion of their
block-producing rewards with the delegator.

While the payment credentials control how to **spend** an output, delegation
credentials control two separate operations:

- how to **publish** a delegation certificate (e.g. to delegate stake to a stake pool);
- how to **withdraw** rewards associated with the stake credentials.

Like payment credentials, delegation credentials comes in two forms: as
verification key hash digest or as script hash digest.

                                                          - withdrawing rewards
```

Before we move on, let's recap again:

- An _address_ is made up of either 2 or 3 parts: it always contains a _header_ and _payment credentials_, and may optionally also contain _delegation credentials_;
- The _header_ describes the _type_ of address and the _network_ it is for;
- the _delegation credentials_ part, while optional, is still <u>highly recommended</u>;
- Credentials (payment or delegation) take one of two forms:
  - a verification key hash;
  - a script hash;
- Payment credentials control how to **spend** from an _address_;
- Delegation credentials control how to **publish** certificates and how to **withdraw** rewards;
- A script allows the definition of arbitrary validation logic.

## Scripts, Datums and Redeemers

### Overview

Hang in there! We are almost at the end of this crash course. We've had a look at what
UTxOs are and what addresses are made of, and we spoke a bit about scripts. In
particular, we said that scripts are like predicates: that is, pure functions
(in the mathematical sense) that take a transaction as an argument and return
either `True` or `False`.

Well, _not exactly_. We lied to you (but only a tiny bit).

If we only had that, it would be hard to express more elaborate logic. In
particular, capturing a state, which programs often require, would be
infeasible. A state and transitions from that state. This is where the
_extended UTxO_ model comes in. It adds two new components to what we've
already seen: datums and redeemers.

We mentioned the datum earlier without calling it a datum when we said that
outputs contained a value, an address and a data payload. This is what the
datum is, a free payload that developers can use to attach data to script
execution. When a script is executed in a spending scenario, it receives not
only the transaction as context but also the datum associated with the output
being spent.

The redeemer, on the other hand, is another piece of data that is also provided
with the transaction for any script execution. Notice that the datum and
redeemer intervene at two distinct moments. A datum is set when the output is
created (i.e. when the post-it note is hung on the wall, it is part of the
note). In contrast,  the redeemer is provided only when spending the output (i.e.
provided along with the form as it is handed over to the employee).

### Analogy

Another way to look at scripts, datums and redeemers is to think of them together as forming
parameterised mathematical functions.

```console filename="Script, datum and redeemer"
             Script
          ╭─────────╮
    f(x) = x * a + b  = true | false
           ╿   ╿   ╿
  Redeemer ┘   │   │
               └─┬─┘
               Datum
```

The script defines the function as a whole. It indicates how the parameters and
arguments are combined to produce a boolean outcome. The datum corresponds to
the parameters of the function. It allows _configuring the function_ and
re-using a similar validation logic with different settings. Both the function
and the parameters are defined when assets are locked in an output. Which
leaves only the function argument to be later provided. That argument is the
redeemer (as well as the rest of the transaction).

This is why scripts are often referred to as _validators_. Unlike some other
blockchain systems, they are also, therefore, fully deterministic. Their
execution only depends on the transaction they're involved with, and evaluating
the transaction's outcome is possible before sending it to the network. Datums
act as local states, and redeemers are user inputs provided in the transaction
itself.

<Callout type="info">
  If we take a step back and look at the typical public/private key procedure
  for spending funds, we can see how eUTxO is merely a generalization of that.
  Indeed, the public key (hash) can be seen as _the datum_, whereas the
  signature is the _redeemer_. The script is the digital signature verification
  algorithm that controls whether the signature is valid w.r.t. the provided key.
</Callout>

### Purposes

So far, we've mostly talked about scripts in the context of validating whether
an output can be spent. We've also briefly mentioned earlier how scripts can be
used to control the publication of delegation certificates or how consensus
rewards can be withdrawn.

These different use cases are commonly referred to as script purposes. Until
now, we've seen three purposes: `spend`, `publish` and `withdraw`. There's a
fourth one: `mint`.

The mint purpose refers to scripts that are executed to validate whether
user-defined assets can be minted (i.e. created) or burned (i.e. destroyed).
Cardano indeed supports user-defined assets which are used to represent both
fungible quantities (like a protocol currency) or non-fungible quantities
(a.k.a NFTs).

The rules that govern the creation or destruction of an asset are defined as a
script. We often refer to such scripts as _minting policies_, which correspond
to the `mint` purpose above.

Each purpose, therefore, indicates _for what purpose_ a script is being
executed. During validation, that information is passed to the script alongside
the transaction and the redeemer. Note that only scripts executed with the
`spend` purpose are given a datum. This is because they can leverage the data
payload present in outputs, unlike the other purposes that do not get this
opportunity.

### TL;DR

And we've reached the end of this crash course. Let's do a final recap
regarding scripts, datums and redeemers.

- _Scripts_ are akin to parameterized predicate functions, returning either true or false.
- _Datums_ take the role of function parameters, whereas _redeemers_ the one of argument.
- _Scripts_ are also called _validators_ and are completely deterministic.
- _Scripts_ are used to validate specific operations in a transaction.
- What a _script_ is used for is referred to as its _purpose_. There are 4 purposes:
  - `spend` -- controls how to spend outputs;
  - `publish` -- controls how to publish delegation certificates;
  - `withdraw` -- controls how to withdraw consensus rewards;
  - `mint` -- controls how to mint or burn assets.
- Only _spending scripts_ (i.e. purpose=spend) have access to a datum.
